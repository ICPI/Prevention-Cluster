## Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC) MER Quarterly Tool Quality Control Process Guide
Last Updated: 7 September 2018


## Overview
This is the standard operating procedure for the QC and validation of the MS Excel VMMC quarterly MER tool. The purpose of the quarterly VMMC tool is to provide analysis and visualization of the VMMC_CIRC MER indicator and its corresponding disaggregates. Tool updates occur twice per quarter when the Fact View datasets are released. The initial tool release contains the unclean quarterly data, which is updated when cleaned data becomes available. 

### QC Process
As part of the QC process each quarter, VMMC work stream members will perform: 
1) Data checks 
2) Functionality checks
3) Aesthetics checks 

These checks should be performed to ensure that data are summing and displaying properly within and across tabs. These processes are described in further detail below. PEPFAR Panorama is primary source for validating all data in the tool (https://pepfar-panorama.org).

Each quarter, the primary analyst (i.e., the analyst responsible for routine tool updates) will complete the first QC review. In addition, a secondary analyst will complete a review to confirm the results. Finally, the VMMC work stream leads will review the tool one last time for functionality and aesthetics. 

### QC Checks

The following checks will be performed quarterly for all tabs within the tool.

#### 1) Functionality Checks
Analysts will begin the QC process by checking the basic functionality of the tool. Starting with the Global tab, analysts will perform each of the following steps to ensure the tool is working properly. Once all functionality check have been performed in the Global Tab, analysts will work their way through each of the remaining tabs, repeating all the below steps to determine that the tool is functioning properly.

*a) Check Slicers*:
Confirm that all slicer filters are working properly. Do results display for all slicer filters? Do results in both the tables and the charts appear to change as you move from one filter to another? If users should be able to select multiple filters at a time, choose two and confirm that results are summing correctly.

*b) Check Table and Chart Titles*
Carefully examine each of the titles for all the tables and charts contained within the tool. Do the titles clearly describe the data displayed? Confirm that titles reference the correct quarter and fiscal year, and that dynamic titles reference the correct agency and/or OU.

*c) Spot Check Chart and Table Data*
Eyeball each chart against the table data to confirm that results are displaying properly. 


Any errors or issues identified during the functionality check will be noted in the appendix table, discussed within the work stream and corrected before the tool is released.

#### 2) Data Checks

*PEPFAR Panorama Validation*:

Begin the data check process by validating the results against Panorama. All of the data can be validated against Panorama. Previously, the follow-up disaggregate required an additional calculation outside of Panorama, but beginning in FY17 Q4, a calculated indicator was created and incorporated into Panorama, which allows data checks for all results against Panarama.

For efficieny, the VMMC team completes a thorough review of the data using the following five VMMC OUs:
1) Botswana
2) Kenya
3) Namibia
4) South Africa
5) Zambia

Analysts performing the QC will record all discrepancies in the appendix table, discuss within the work stream, and correct in the tool before its release. If there appears to be an error with the data in Panorama, we will confirm against final.DATIM and alert the Panorama team. 

#### 3) Aesthetics Checks
Finally, VMMC work stream analysts and review leads will perform aesthetics checks to ensure the color scheme is consistent across graphs, size and bolding of text is consistent across tabs, and nomenclature is consistent throughout the tool. This review will include a final spell check of the tool. Any issues identified will be documented and brought to the work stream to resolve.
