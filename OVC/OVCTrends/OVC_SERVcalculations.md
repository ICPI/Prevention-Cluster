## DETAILED Changes for OVC_SERV Results

### FY2017

The numerator is the sum of the following Program participation disaggregations:
1. Active beneficiaries
2. Graduated beneficiaries
3. Transferred beneficiaries
4. Exited without graduation in the reporting period, from the PEPFAR OVC Program

**“Active beneficiary”** is an individual, a child, or parent/caregiver who has received at least one PEPFAR OVC program service in the last three months. New beneficiaries registered during the reporting period can be counted as active only if they have received at least one service in the last three months.

OVC_SERV (age 0-17) APR Total Numerator = Q4 Active + (Q2+Q4 Graduated) + (Q2+Q4 Transferred) + (Q2+Q4 Exited)

Ref: MER 2.0 Indicator Reference Guide v2.1 (January 2017 release)

Update: Only those OVCs that actually received services in the past three months should be counted in this indicator. OVCs that have registered for the OVC program, but have not yet received any services should not be counted in the results. (p.10) Ref: MER 2.0 Indicator Reference Guide v2.2(October 2017 release)

### FY2018

OVC_SERV: Requirements for OVC_SERV have changed significantly in FY 2018. The indicator calculation has been updated and OVC_SERV will return to being a snapshot indicator again for FY 18 reporting. Results should not be summed across reporting periods.

The numerator is the sum of the following Program participation disaggregations:
1. Active beneficiaries
2. Graduated beneficiaries

**“Active beneficiary”** is an individual, a child, or parent/caregiver who has received at least one PEPFAR OVC program service in the last three months. New beneficiaries registered during the reporting period can be counted as active only if they have received at least one service in the last three months.

To calculate data for annual results for OVC_SERV:
Sum Active (children and caregivers received services in the past three months) + Graduated (OVCs that graduated from the OVC program in the past 12 months).

Ref: MER 2.0 Indicator Reference Guide v2.1 (January 2018 release


### FY2019

The numerator is the sum of the following Program Participation Status disaggregates:
1. Active beneficiaries (children and caregivers) 
2. Graduated beneficiaries (children and caregivers graduated in the reporting period)
disaggregated by: <1 F/M, 1-4 F/M, 5-9 F/M, 10-14 F/M, 15-17 F/M, 18+ F/M

**“Active beneficiary”** is an individual, a child or caregiver, who has received at least one PEPFAR OVC program service in each of the preceding two quarters. New beneficiaries registered during the reporting period can be counted as active only if they have received at least one service in the last quarter.

To calculate data for annual results for OVC_SERV:
Sum the reported number of Q4 Active (children and caregivers who received services in each of the preceding two quarters (Q3 + Q4)) + Q4 Graduated (all OVC that graduated from the OVC program in the fiscal year).

Q4 OVC_SERV = (Active Q4) + (Graduated Q4)
